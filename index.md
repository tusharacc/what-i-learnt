Programming is full of pitfalls for me. I think I know something, and then the programming god humbles me by teaching me a lesson. I have been grappling for months and years to do something of my own. I tried creating mini-posts, but then I felt I was not adding value. Now, I have stumbled upon the idea of journaling my programming journey, the mistakes I make, what it teaches me, and how it makes me a better programmer.
