title: "Typing, Strong vs Weak, Static vs Dynamic"

> For a long time, I thought Python was weakly typed programming language, because we don't need to define the type of variable. 

Let's define Type Systems!

Type system is basically set of rules governing allocation of memory, operations allowed etc. Programming language can be - 

1. Statically typed vs Dynamically typed
2. Strongly typed vs weakly typed

`STATICALLY TYPED` languages are those where in programmer defines the type of variable, such as in `C\C++`
```
int x = 0
```

My understanding of `statically typed` language is wrong, because in `Go`, I can define a variable like

```
x := 0
```

As per my understanding, this should be `not` statically typed, but `Go` is statically typed language. The correct interpretation is, in statically typed language the type of a variable is known as compile time.

This definition of static typing, makes dynamic typing definition obvious, which is, when the type is known as run-time, which is the case in `python`, `javascript`.

What about `strong` typing. These are the rules govering operations for a type. In python, one cannot add a `int` with a `string`, hence python is strongly types, while in javascript, one can go crazy, which makes it weakly typed.

That's all for now, Have fun!!
