# Hiring — One Commit at a Time

I have not been happy with the hiring process for a very long time.  
It’s time-consuming, repetitive, and worst of all — it doesn’t help a candidate grow.  
Somewhere between résumé polishing and HR follow-ups, the whole thing loses its soul.  
And let’s be honest — the process is not for the faint-hearted (or the faintly caffeinated).

Given the amount of data available publicly, hiring a developer *should* be simple.  
A LinkedIn profile, a GitHub repo, a few LeetCode submissions, some Stack Overflow karma, maybe a personal blog — that’s practically a developer’s autobiography.  
Why ask them to draft a résumé (and definitely not a cover story — we’re hiring devs, not novelists)?

### The Current Saga: A TA Tale

Once the hiring requisition is approved, the clock starts ticking.

- A JD is posted.  
- The TA team is informed.  
- They search LinkedIn, Naukri, or the internal database for potential candidates.  
- They reach out to a few people, collect résumés, talk to some of them.  
- Profiles are shared with the hiring manager.  
- Hiring manager approves or rejects.

Meanwhile, somewhere out there, a candidate has spent hours writing a résumé, possibly rehearsing answers, and maybe even buying a new shirt.  
Then… *silence*.  
No one knows why they were rejected. No one gets better. The process just repeats.

### Enter: Smart Hire

I decided to change this loop.  
Meet **Smart Hire** — a developer hiring system that doesn’t rely on “gut feeling” but rather on *Git activity*.  

Here’s how it works:  
The company posts a job, a candidate applies using their LinkedIn profile.  
Smart Hire automatically analyzes the profile against the job description and gives it a **similarity score**.  

Now, here’s the fun part — candidates can earn **bonus points**:  
- Active GitHub repos? ✅  
- Consistent LeetCode submissions? ✅  
- Helping others on Stack Overflow? ✅  
- Writing tech blogs? Double ✅  

If the final score is above the threshold (set by the hiring manager), the candidate can *immediately* book an interview slot.  
No recruiter ping-pong, no “we’ll get back to you.”  

And if the score doesn’t meet the mark?  
Smart Hire gently (and smartly) explains what’s missing — maybe a specific skill, a side project idea, or a Udemy course to bridge the gap.  
So even if you don’t qualify *today*, you walk away *wiser*.

### What Makes It “Smart” (Without Saying AI)

Smart Hire doesn’t just scrape profiles — it *understands* them.  
It can tell that “React”, “ReactJS”, and “React.js” are the same thing (unlike some job portals that think they’re three separate careers).  
It knows when a candidate is diversifying tech stacks or continuously learning.  
It even writes empathetic feedback — the kind that says “you’re doing great” *before* pointing out the gaps.

Under the hood, it’s powered by some serious tech:

- **Frontend**: Angular  
- **Backend**: Express.js  
- **Database**: SQLite (for the POC)  
- **Brain**: GPT (but we’re not saying that out loud)  
- **Integrations**: LinkedIn, GitHub, Stack Overflow, LeetCode, Blog  

Basically, it’s like a hiring assistant that actually reads your code instead of your résumé.

### Why Bother?

Because rejection shouldn’t feel like a void.  
Because a developer’s work should speak louder than bullet points.  
Because recruiters deserve tools that save them from copy-pasting JD lines into LinkedIn search bars.

Smart Hire isn’t just automating hiring — it’s making it *fair*, *transparent*, and dare I say, a little *human*.  

It’s hiring — one commit at a time.
